CloudBall
=========

TODO:
- find a way to check free players in attack
- pass to free player in attack
- leave two defenders behind enemy forwards - three players in attack should be enough
- we have no keeper
- shooting on goal is awful - target corners


Pending tasks:
- add logic for attack/defence flag SS
- add role selector for squad SS
- add defensive roles
-- goalkeeper MS
-- defender against ball carrier DK
-- defender against other players VP




Notes below
===========
- Remember of tackle timer
- Remember of fallen timer
- Remember of inertion
- Check if ball could be held infinitively
